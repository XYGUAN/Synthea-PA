    class Immunizations < Synthea::Rules
      # This is a complete, but fairly simplistic approach to synthesizing immunizations.  It is encounter driven;
      # whenever an encounter occurs, the doctor checks for due immunizations and gives them.  In at least one case
      # (HPV) this means that the immunization schedule isn't strictly followed since the encounter schedule doesn't
      # match the immunization schedule (e.g., 11yrs, 11yrs2mo, 11yrs6mo) -- but in most cases they do line up.
      # This module also assumes perfect doctors and compliant patients.  Every patient eventually receives every
      # recommended immunization (unless they die first).  This module also does not implement any deviations or
      # contraindications based on patient conditions.  For now, we've avoided specific brand names, preferring the
      # general CVX codes.

        # vaccine is released; we can't just use a simple test of, say, within 4 years after the recommended
        # age for the next dose they haven't received because ie PCV13 is given to kids and seniors but was
        # only available starting in 2010, so a senior in 2012 who has never received a dose should get one,
        # but only one; what we do is

        !at_months.empty? && age_in_months >= at_months.first

        # Note: the approach used here still has some issues, mostly due to odd interactions between
        # vaccination availability dates and how we schedule adult vaccinations. For example, the PCV13
        # vaccine is administered to adults over 65, but if the adult is already older than 69 (65 + 4) when
        # the vaccine is made available in 2012, step 1 above causes the dose to not be administered at all
